Each device can be found using mDNS and filtering the service type to one of the following:

    _netaudio-cmc._udp
    _netaudio-dbc._udp
    _netaudio-arc._udp
    _netaudio-chan._udp

Most of these describe the device, but _netaudio-chan._udp describes individual channels. It isn't present on all hardware. The ports used by each service are described here.

Some commmon examples of ports used are these:

    24440 (Audio control, VIA)
    24455 (Audio control, VIA)
    4440 (Audio control)
    4455 (Audio control)
    8800 (Control & Monitoring)
    8700 (Device settings such as sample rate, encoding, level control)

The ports for routing are the audio control ones (_netaudio-arc._udp). Port 8700 isn't advertised as a mNDS service.
